# GraphQL Sandbox

This repo covers setting up an Apollo Server for a GraphQL API, defining types and resolvers, and implementing queries and mutations with a mock database, providing a solid foundation in GraphQL development. Created from following tutotal from Net Ninja

## Concepts applied:

- Installing and configuring Apollo Server.
- Starting a standalone Apollo Server.
- GraphQL Schema Definition:
- Defining types (Game, Review, Author) using GraphQL schema language.
- Defining queries and mutations.

## Resolvers:

- Writing resolvers for queries and mutations.
- Implementing resolver functions to interact with a mock database.

## Handling Relationships in GraphQL:

- Creating relationships between types (e.g., Game and Review, Review and Author).

## Mock Database:

- Setting up a mock database to simulate data storage.
- Using mock data within resolver functions.

## Asynchronous Operations:

- Utilizing async and await for handling asynchronous server operations.

## GraphQL Queries and Mutations:

- Writing and testing basic GraphQL queries.
- Writing and testing GraphQL mutations to add, update, and delete data.
